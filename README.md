  # README-Generator
  ## Description
  This application generates a professional and organized README.md file that is ready to use once the users information is entered via the prompts in terminal. The items in the table of contents are clickable and will take you to that section of the README file. The license, github and walkthrough links are all clickable and will take you to the agreement, github page, and video respectively. There is also a space left for screenshots if you would like to add them for your application. This README file was created using the generator.
